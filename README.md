PHP Syntax

A PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser.

1. A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

2. A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>

3. The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".

Note: 

1. PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).

2. In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.

In PHP, we can use either double slash (//) or hash (#) for single commented lines and /* and */ for the multiple commented lines.

PHP Variables

In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for PHP variables:

1. A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable

2. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character

3. A variable name cannot start with a number

4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )

5. Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen.
